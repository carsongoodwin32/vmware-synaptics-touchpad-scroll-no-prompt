**AUTOSTART BATCH EXAMPLE CODE**
================================

To use:

1. Add vmrun directory to PATH (Link below)
2. Change second line of batch file to correspond to your .VMX location
3. Move "Release" folder from GitHub download into the root of your VMWare install location (default is already entered, just make sure it matches)
4. Run this batch file as ADMIN to start your VM with scroll support (or make a Shortcut for your desktop and set that to autostart as ADMIN)

To add vmrun to PATH, visit Page 6 of:

https://www.vmware.com/pdf/vix162_vmrun_command.pdf

Look under "Setting Up vmrun on Windows"

(I had to add C:\Program Files (x86)\VMware\VMware Workstation to PATH on my machine because the default didn't work correctly)
